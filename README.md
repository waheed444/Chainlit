## Installation

Before you begin, ensure you have Python 3.10 or higher installed.  We recommend using `uv` for faster dependency installation and hot reloading, but `pip` is also supported.


1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/waheed444/Chainlit.git
cd chainlit-agent-ui
```

2. **Install Chainlit:**

   * **Using `uv` (recommended):**

     ```bash
     uv add chainlit
     ```

   * **Using `pip`:**

     ```bash
     pip install chainlit
     ```

## Usage

To run the application locally:

```bash
chainlit run main.py -w   # For uv users : uv run chainlit run main.py -w 
```

The `-w` flag enables hot reloading, allowing you to see changes reflected instantly without restarting the server.

Once the application is running, open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000` to interact with your agent.
